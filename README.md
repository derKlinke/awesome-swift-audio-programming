## AVFoundaition 


Framework for basic audio and video operations, eg. recording and playback of audio. Not reccomended for more complex audio operations, use AudioKit instead (AudioKit provides nice wrappers and extensions arround AVFoundation tailored towards audio development)

## CoreML & ARKit


Machine Learnign frameworks with prebuilt models and model generator CreateML for integrating ML in Swift apps - which are then running on the Neural Engine auf Apple SoC. 

Example Apps:

**Human Body Pose Detection:**
